Requirements: 
Design a circular double linked list, 

for which the following operations should be implemented:
Search for a given element in the structure
Insert an element after some element, specified as argument
Delete an element specified as argument
List all the elements present in the double linked list. 


Approach: 
You should show the functionality by repeatedly inserting a few (at least 5) elements, 
followed by at least one search and one delete operation. 

After each operation performed, display the elements in the list. 

The elements should be displayed either in the output window of the IDE, or in a GUI 
(however, designing a GUI is not mandatory; your work is considered for full grade without a GUI).
 
Deliverables: 
You should submit 
(1) the souce (.java) files, 
(2) an output sample (screenshot showing program execution and the results of your testing) and 
(3) a document file describing your solution. 
The solution description document should include the following elements: 
a short problem analysis, 
main design decisions, 
user interface, 
testing and test cases, 
error handling
lessons learned. 
 
The size of the document should be of 1-2 pages, single spaced, 
font size 12. All solution description elements should be properly formatted using APA style.
 
Wrapp all the files in a single .zip archive and name it Hw3_your_name.zip (if I were you, it would be Hw3_Rodica_Potolea.zip).

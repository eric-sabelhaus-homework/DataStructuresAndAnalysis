consider a method which calculates and returns the following series:
S(i) = 1 + 1/22 + 1/32+ 1/42 + 1/52 â€¦ + 1/i2 .

The argument (i) has to be provided by user. The output is the value of S(i) which should be displayed either in the output window of the IDE, or in 
a GUI (however, designing a GUI is not mandatory, and your work is considered for full grade without a GUI).

a)  Design and implement seriesIter, the iterative version of the method.
b)  Design and implement seriesRec, the recursive version of the method.
c)  Write a driver program TestSeriesVal.java to test the two methods.

Submission requirements
Your completed assignment consists of all the java files and an output sample (the result obtained in the output window of the IDE) wrapped in a zip archive. Name the archive Hw1_your_name (if I were you, it would be Hw1_Rodica_Potolea.zip)
